### How to use it

1. Copy that markdown into your `README.md` in Overleaf’s Git bridge or directly on GitHub.  
2. Replace `YOUR_DOI` in the citation block once you mint your Zenodo DOI.  
3. Ensure the Colab badge image you uploaded matches the file name in the `images/` section.  
4. Tweak any paths if your folder names differ.

With this README in place, readers get one-click access to Colab, clear guidance on what’s inside, and a formal citation template. Let me know if you’d like to adjust any section!
